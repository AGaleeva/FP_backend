# FP_backend

Welcome to the backend of our portal, FP_backend. This README provides an overview of the key technologies and frameworks utilized in the project, ensuring efficient development, robust security, and scalable performance.

## Technologies Used

### Maven
Maven is an efficient tool for managing and automating project builds. It utilizes `pom.xml` files to fine-tune dependencies and modules, ensuring that all components of the project are well-organized and consistently built.

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot accelerates the development process by simplifying the configuration and deployment of web applications. With its built-in server and extensive autoconfiguration capabilities, it streamlines the creation of production-ready applications.

### Spring Security
Spring Security offers comprehensive security features, including authentication and authorization, attack protection, and data encryption. This ensures that the application remains secure and resilient against various threats.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT enables the secure transfer of information between the client and server as JSON objects. These tokens are signed and encrypted, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data being exchanged.

### Spring Data JPA
Spring Data JPA simplifies database operations by providing a convenient way to organize data in a repository and retrieve it using simple interfaces and methods. This abstraction over traditional database interactions increases productivity and code readability.

### MySQL
MySQL is a robust and scalable database management system. It provides fast access and efficient management of large amounts of information, making it an ideal choice for handling the backend data needs of the portal.

### Jsoup
Jsoup is a powerful HTML parsing library used for extracting and manipulating data from web sources. It allows for easy retrieval and manipulation of web content, facilitating various data extraction and web scraping tasks.

### Google Cloud Translate API
The Google Cloud Translate API integrates with Google Cloud Services to extend functionality and utilize powerful data processing tools. It provides capabilities for translating text between languages, enhancing the accessibility and usability of the portal for a global audience.
